## Detailed contracts

The following sections are taken from the [standard library specification](Stdlib-Design) and the module's source comments. The source and the [language status](Status) identify shipped behavior.

### 5.2 Equality, hashing, and text

The compiler supplies these results for supported value members. Companion functions such as `Int32.hash` and `Strings.equals` use the same contracts. For types with custom equality, equal values must have the same hash.

| Type | Equal when | Hash | Text |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `bool` | Same value | 1231 for true, 1237 for false | `true` or `false` |
| Integers up to 32 bits | Same value | The value's 32-bit two's complement pattern as a `uint32` | Decimal, `-` for negatives, no leading zeros |
| `int64`, `uint64` | Same value | Low 32 bits exclusive-or high 32 bits | Decimal, as above |
| Floats | Same bit pattern, except that every NaN equals every NaN. `0.0` and `-0.0` are **not** equal. | The bit pattern with every NaN replaced by the canonical NaN; 16-bit patterns zero-extended, the 64-bit pattern folded like `uint64` | [Section 7.5](Stdlib-Design#75-float-text-conversion) |
| Fieldless enum | Same variant | The ordinal | The variant name |
| `string` | Same bytes | Start with 0; for each byte, 31 times the hash plus the byte, wrapping | The string itself |
| Tuple | Same element types and each pair of elements equal, in order | Start with 1; for each element, 31 times the hash plus the element's hash, wrapping | `[`, the elements' text separated by `, `, `]` |
| Array, list | Same kind, same length, and each pair of elements equal in index order | As for a tuple | As for a tuple |
| Class (default, G3b) | Identity | The identity number times 2,654,435,761, wrapping | The qualified class name, `#`, and the identity number, for example `Acme.Shapes.Circle#3` |
| Function value | Not comparable | None | None |
| Payload enum | Not provided | Not provided | Not provided |

Float equality here deliberately differs from `==`: it is an equivalence relation consistent with the hash, which hash tables need, while `==` stays IEEE 754. The multiplier 31 is chosen because multiplying by 31 is a shift and a subtraction.

The module **`Hash`** has the building blocks, all ordinary functions:

| Member | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `combine(seed: uint32, value: uint32) → uint32` | 31 times `seed` plus `value`, wrapping. Computed in `uint64`: the product is below 2^37, so nothing overflows before the mask. |
| `spread(hash: uint32) → uint32` | `hash` exclusive-or `hash` shifted right by 16. Hash tables apply this before masking. |
| `of_bool`, `of_int64`, `of_uint64` | The table's results for those types. |

A class's hash starts from 17 and combines each field's hash in declaration order.

**The contract for a class that overrides the G3b members:** `equals` is an equivalence relation; equal values have equal hashes; neither traps nor modifies the value; and while an object is a key in a hash collection its hash and equality do not change. The library does not detect violations.

**Self-containing collections.** A collection's text prints `(this collection)` wherever that text reaches the collection again, so a collection that contains itself, directly or through other collections, has finite text. The marker names the collection whose text was already being built: for a list `a` holding a list `b` that holds `a`, `a.to_string()` is `[[(this collection)]]`.

### 6.1 `Optional<T>`

**`Optional<T>` is a generic payload enum with the variants `None` and `Some(T)`, read with `match`.** The enum cannot be read without handling both cases, has no trapping accessor to misuse, and needs no late field.

Requires G2. The module `Optional` exports the enum and these functions; the last column says what each needs beyond G2.

| Function | Behavior | Also needs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `is_some<T>(o) → bool`, `is_none<T>(o) → bool` | | |
| `value_or<T>(o, fallback: T) → T` | The value, or `fallback`. | |
| `expect<T>(o, detail: string) → T` | The value, or a trap with `no such element` followed by `: ` and `detail`. | |
| `to_result<T>(o, error: Error) → Result<T>` | `Ok` of the value, or `Err` of `error`. | |
| `map<T, U>(o, f: (T) → U) → Optional<U>` | | G1 |
| `and_then<T, U>(o, f: (T) → Optional<U>) → Optional<U>` | | G1 |
| `filter<T>(o, keep: (T) → bool) → Optional<T>` | | G1 |
| `value_or_else<T>(o, make: () → T) → T` | Calls `make` only for `None`. | G1 |
| `or_else<T>(o, other: () → Optional<T>) → Optional<T>` | `o` when it is `Some`, otherwise the result of `other`. | G1 |
| `equals<T>(a, b) → bool`, `hash<T>(o) → uint32`, `to_string<T>(o) → string` | Both `None`, or both `Some` with equal values. Hash 0 for `None`, otherwise `Hash.combine(1, value hash)`. Text `None` or `Some(` value `)`. | G3a |

The mapping functions are conveniences. A `match` is useful when the cases require different control flow or the caller wants to avoid a callback.

### 9.2 Equality of collections

All of this needs G3.

| Kind | Equal when | Hash | Text |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| List | Same class and size, with equal elements at each index | The list formula of [section 5.2](Stdlib-Design#52-equality-hashing-and-text) | `[a, b, c]` |
| Set | Same class and size, and this set contains each of the other's elements | The wrapping sum of the element hashes | `{a, b, c}` in iteration order |
| Map | Same class and size, and for each of the other's entries this map holds an equal value for the key | The wrapping sum over entries of key hash exclusive-or value hash | `{k: v, k2: v2}` in iteration order |
| `ArrayDeque`, `PriorityQueue`, `Sequence` | Identity | Identity | `[a, b, c]` in iteration order; `Sequence` prints `Sequence` |

`equals(other: class)` first tests whether `other` is an instance of the same collection type. It then downcasts and compares contents. Comparing an `ArrayList` with a `LinkedList` by content is the separate `Lists.same_elements` function over the list interface.

### 9.6 Hash collections

Hash collections iterate in **insertion order**, so output never depends on hash values, and the load factor is fixed at one half.

The index and entry tables are built-in lists grown by `append`. The shared probing core uses indices and hash values. Constructors can use specialized default value members or accept caller-supplied key operations.

#### Layout comparison

| Layout | Storage operations per successful lookup | Objects per entry | Removed entry released | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Parallel lists: an integer index plus dense lists of hashes, keys, and values | Index read, hash read, key read, value read | None | At the next compaction, which is bounded (below) | **Chosen.** Probing touches only integers, insertion order is free, and nothing is allocated per entry. |
| One list of entry objects, with a shared empty object in removed slots | Index read, entry read, then a field read for each of hash, key, and value | One | Immediately | One more operation on every probe that reaches an entry, and an allocation per insertion. |
| Chained bucket nodes | A bucket read, then per node a field read for hash, key, and next | One | Immediately | Needs a second structure to keep insertion order. |

#### `HashCore`

`Std.Collections.Internal.HashCore` is a **non-generic** class. It knows hashes and entry numbers. It never sees a key. The owning collection keeps the keys and values in its own dense lists, indexed by entry number, and does the key comparison itself. One core therefore serves every hash collection, including `IntMap` and `StringMap`.

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `index` | `int` list of length `T` | Open-addressed table. Each slot holds an entry number, -1 (`Empty`), or -2 (`Tombstone`). `T` is a power of two, at least 8. |
| `hashes` | `uint32` list | Each entry's spread hash, in insertion order. Its length is `used`. |
| `live` | `bool` list | False for a removed entry. Same length. |
| `count` | `int` | Live entries. |
| `modifications` | `uint64` | The modification count ([section 5.4](Stdlib-Design#54-iteration)). |

`E`, the entry capacity, is `T / 2`. At most half of the index is ever non-empty, because each entry occupies one slot. One half is chosen because lookups use linear probing: at half load an unsuccessful search inspects about 2.5 slots on average and a successful one about 1.5, and every inspected entry costs a comparison circuit. The index holds only integers, so a sparse table is cheap.

The core's operations, as the owner uses them:

- **Lookup.** The owner computes the spread hash, asks for the home slot (the hash masked with `T - 1`), and walks slots in increasing order, wrapping. `Empty` ends the search: absent. `Tombstone` continues. An entry number whose cached hash equals the probe's hash is a candidate: the owner compares its stored key with the probe key, and stops on a match. The probe key is the first argument to the equality. The loop terminates because at least half the slots are `Empty`.
- **Claim.** For a new key the owner remembers the first `Tombstone` it passed. The core appends the hash and `true` to its lists, writes the new entry number into the remembered tombstone or the final `Empty` slot, and advances `count` and the modification count. The owner appends the key and value to its lists in the same step, so entry numbers agree.
- **Release.** The slot becomes `Tombstone`, the entry's `live` flag becomes false, `count` decreases, and the modification count advances. If the released entry is the last one, it and any dead entries before it are removed from the ends of all the dense lists at once, so stack-like use retains nothing.
- **Compaction.** The core returns the old entry numbers of the live entries in order. The owner builds new key and value lists in that order; the core rebuilds `hashes`, `live`, and `index` by probing from each cached hash for the first `Empty` slot. No hash or equality function is called. It runs in a helper function that returns the new lists ([section 5.5](Stdlib-Design#55-resources)).

When compaction happens:

1. A new key arrives and `used` equals `E`, or the live entries plus the tombstones in the index fill `E` (trailing releases leave tombstones behind). If `count` is greater than `E / 2`, `T` doubles first. A `T` above 2^30 traps with `invalid argument: capacity`.
2. A release leaves more dead entries than live ones and at least 8 dead entries. `T` is unchanged.

**Retention bound.** A removed key and value stay in the owner's dense lists, and so stay reachable, until the next compaction. Rule 2 bounds this: a hash collection never holds more dead entries than `max(count, 7)`. Compaction costs time proportional to `count` and happens after more than `count` releases, so removal stays amortized constant time. Nothing observable depends on the retained references, since reclamation runs no code; only heap use does.

`clear` replaces every list with a new one of the initial size. The table never shrinks on its own; `trim()` compacts at the smallest `T` whose `E` holds `count`.

**Costs.** Lookup, insertion, and removal are expected constant time with well-distributed hashes and linear in `used` in the worst case. There is no conversion of long probe sequences into trees. Code that hashes adversarial keys uses `TreeMap`.

#### The collections

| Class | Keys | Key operations | Needs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `IntMap<V>` | `int` | `Int32.hash` and `==`, called directly | Nothing |
| `StringMap<V>` | `string` | `Strings.hash` and `Strings.equals` | T1 |
| `HashMap<K, V>`, `HashSet<T>` created with `with_keys<K, V>(hash: (K) → uint32, same: (K, K) → bool)` | Any | The two function values, stored in the collection | G1 |
| `HashMap<K, V>`, `HashSet<T>` created with `create<K, V>()` | Any | `hash_code` and `equals` | G3 |

- `IntMap` and `StringMap` are permanent, not stopgaps. They follow the map contract with their key type fixed, call their key operations directly without a function value, and are the right choice for those key types after `HashMap` exists.
- `HashMap` stores its two key operations as fields either way. `create` fills them with the universal members, so the rest of the class is written once.
- `HashSet` owns a `HashCore` and a keys list. `HashMap` owns a `HashCore`, a keys list, and a values list.
- `with_capacity` variants of each constructor choose the smallest power-of-two `T` that is at least `max(8, 2n)`; a negative `n` or one above 2^29 traps.
- Setting a value for an existing key overwrites the value only: the entry keeps its position and the modification count does not change. A key removed and added again goes to the end of the order.
- Iteration visits entry numbers in order and skips dead entries.
- A callback passed to `get_or_put`, `merge`, or `compute` must not modify the map ([section 5.6](Stdlib-Design#56-callbacks)).

### 10.2 `BigInteger`

An immutable arbitrary-precision integer. Parsing uses T1 and conversion to `float64` uses N1.

- **Layout.** `sign` (`int`: -1, 0, or 1) and `magnitude`, a built-in `uint32` list of limbs, least significant first, with no zero limb at the top. Zero has sign 0 and an empty magnitude. The form is unique, so equality compares the fields. No method changes the list after construction.
- **Limits.** At most 2^26 limbs; a larger result traps with `invalid argument: magnitude too large`.
- **Module functions.** The constants `Zero`, `One`, `Ten`; `of_int64`, `of_uint64`; `parse(text)` and `parse_radix(text, radix)` returning `Result<BigInteger>`, with the grammar of [section 7.1](Stdlib-Design#71-integer-modules) and no range failure.

| Operation | Algorithm |
| --- | --- |
| `add`, `subtract` | Limb-wise with carry or borrow held in `uint64`; signs handled by comparing magnitudes. |
| `multiply` | Schoolbook with `uint64` partial products, which fit by the limb row of [section 7.2](Stdlib-Design#72-arithmetic-without-wrapping-intrinsics). When both operands have at least 48 limbs, Karatsuba: split at half of the larger length and recurse. |
| `divide`, `remainder` | Knuth's Algorithm D in base 2^32. The quotient truncates toward zero and the remainder takes the dividend's sign, matching the integer operators. A single-limb divisor uses the short division loop. A zero divisor traps (reason 1), from the division it performs. |
| `divide_and_remainder(other) → [BigInteger, BigInteger]` | Both results from one division, as a tuple. |
| `floor_mod(m)` | Non-negative result for a positive modulus. |
| `pow(exponent: int)` | Square and multiply. A negative exponent traps. |
| `gcd(other)` | Euclid's algorithm with `remainder`; the result is non-negative. |
| `mod_pow(exponent, modulus)` | Left-to-right binary exponentiation, reducing after each step. A negative exponent or a non-positive modulus traps. |
| `mod_inverse(modulus) → BigInteger` | Extended Euclid. Returns `nil` when no inverse exists. |
| `negate`, `abs`, `sign`, `is_zero`, `is_even` | |
| `shift_left(n)`, `shift_right(n)` | `shift_right` rounds toward negative infinity. A negative `n` traps. Limb shifts use counts from 1 through 31, so the built-in shifts never trap. |
| `bit_length() → int`, `test_bit(n) → bool` | Of the magnitude. |
| `compare_to(other) → Ordering`, `equals(other)`, `hash_code()` | Hash: start at 0, combine each limb from most to least significant, then negate (wrapping) for a negative value. |
| `to_int64() → Optional<int64>`, `to_float64() → float64` | `to_float64` rounds to nearest, ties to even, and gives an infinity beyond the range. |
| `to_string()`, `to_string_radix(radix)` | Radix 10 divides repeatedly by 10^9 and joins nine-digit groups. |

`BigInteger` has no bitwise and, or, or exclusive or.

### 18.9 Hash collections, trees, and sequences

- **Compaction rule 1** also compacts when live entries plus tombstones fill `E`. Trailing releases leave tombstones behind, so without this addition the index could fill and a lookup for a missing key would not terminate.
- **Modification counts are `uint64`**, as [section 5.4](Stdlib-Design#54-iteration) states; compaction and `trim()` advance them, so an iterator traps after either. `clear()` returns to the table size chosen at construction.
- **Bulk removal.** `remove_if` and `retain_if` call the callback on every entry, then release the chosen entries and compact at most once. `compute` returns the result of its callback. A `with_keys` collection hashes with its stored function, so `hash_code` agrees with its equality.
- **IntMap and StringMap** are generated from `hash-map.nra` with the key operations called directly (`tests/stdlib/hash-map/generators/gen_maps.py`); `StringMap` uses the string's built-in `hash_code` and `==`, which equal `Strings.hash` and `Strings.equals`, because `Std.Text` is above `Std.Collections` in the dependency order.
- **Extra members.** `with_keys_and_capacity`; `trim` and `validate` on every hash collection; `TreeMap.key_iterator`, `key_range`, and `descending_keys`, which `TreeSet` uses to avoid a tuple per element; `Sequence.from_iterator`, a public `Sequence` constructor from two functions, and `Sequence.iterator()` so that a sequence works once in for-each. Constructors of these collections take a module-private token, so only their module functions build them.
- **Sequence choices.** `range(from, to)` on a sorted collection is empty when `to` is not above `from`. `windowed` emits only full windows. `zip` and `chain` mark the other sequence used. `from_list` fails fast on a structural change to its list. `sum_float64` starts from the first element, so `[-0.0]` sums to `-0.0`, and an empty sequence sums to `0.0`. Maps and sets have no `sequence()` member; `ArrayList` and `LinkedList` build theirs with `from_iterator`.
- **Trap details.** `duplicate key`, `negative count`, `chunk size`, and `window size` after `invalid argument: `; `invalid state: hash table …` and `invalid state: tree …` for a failed `validate()`.
