### 5.5 Resources

- A host resource (`File`, `TcpStream`, `TcpListener`) has `close() → Result<Unit>`. Closing again does nothing and returns `Ok`. Any other operation on a closed resource returns an `Io` error of kind `Closed`. If `close` reports an error the resource is still closed.
- **Results that must be used.** The functions and methods of `Std.Io`, `Std.Fs`, and `Std.Net` whose `Result` can report a failed read, write, open, connection, or file system operation are tagged `#NoDiscard`, and so are the classes `File`, `TcpStream`, and `TcpListener`: a statement that drops such a result warns with `W0003` ([Tags](Tags#nodiscard)), and `let _ = ...;` drops one on purpose. `close()` is not tagged.
- **Closing is always explicit.** Reclaiming an unreachable resource object frees its storage and does nothing else: `deinit` does not run and the host ID stays open until the run ends. No library class declares `deinit`. `Fs` and `Net` each allow at most 1,024 simultaneously open IDs per run; exceeding that returns an `Io` error of kind `Other`.
- **Scoped helpers.** `File.with_open<T>(path, mode, body: (File) → Result<T>) → Result<T>` and `TcpStream.with_connection<T>(host, port, body: (TcpStream) → Result<T>) → Result<T>` open the resource, run the body, and close the resource exactly once on every ordinary completion: a returned value, a returned error, and a return after the body's scope was cancelled. With tasks a body can end early by cancellation, and the close must still happen ([Concurrency](Concurrency#7-cancellation-deadlines-and-resources)).
  - If the open fails, the helper returns that error and does not call the body.
  - The body runs in a `scope` the helper owns, so every task started in that scope has finished before the resource is closed.
  - If the close succeeds, the helper returns the body's result unchanged. If the close fails after a body `Ok`, it returns the close error. If the close fails after a body `Err`, it returns a `Context` error whose cause is the body's error and whose message carries the close error's message: `closing the resource also failed: ` and that message from `with_open`, `close failed after the body failed: ` and that message from `with_connection`.
  - A file is closed even when the body closed it already, which reports no error. `with_connection` connects without a time limit.
  - A trap in the body ends the run without cleanup; the runner then closes what the run left open.
- **`Closeable.release<T>(resource: Closeable, outcome: Result<T>) → Result<T>`** is the closing rule on its own: it closes the resource and combines the result with the outcome of the work, as `with_open` does. A program that owns another kind of closeable resource calls it exactly once, after the work, on every ordinary completion.
- Where a wrapper owns a closeable resource, it can use the `Closeable` interface. A wrapper over a bare function value does not own or close the function's receiver.
- **Frame slots keep storage alive.** A reference in a local stays reachable until the local is overwritten or the function returns ([NVM](NVM#garbage-collection)). The rule for library code: an operation that replaces a large structure (a hash rebuild, a sort buffer, a deque rebalance) does the work in a helper function and returns the new structure, so the old one's last frame reference dies when the helper returns and not when the caller's loop ends.

### 6.2 `Result<T>`

**`Result<T>` is a generic payload enum with the variants `Ok(T)` and `Err(Error)`.** It is the one representation of a fallible outcome. An operation with no value returns `Result<Unit>`. The error type is fixed to `Error` so that every fallible function composes with every other.

Requires G2. The module `Result` exports the enum and:

| Function | Behavior | Also needs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `is_ok<T>(r) → bool`, `is_err<T>(r) → bool` | | |
| `value_or<T>(r, fallback: T) → T` | | |
| `expect<T>(r, detail: string) → T` | The value, or a trap whose message is `detail`, `: `, and the error's message. For failures the caller has decided are impossible. | |
| `to_optional<T>(r) → Optional<T>` | Discards the error. | |
| `with_context<T>(r, message: string) → Result<T>` | An `Err` becomes an `Err` of a `Context` error wrapping the original; an `Ok` is returned unchanged. | |
| `map<T, U>(r, f: (T) → U) → Result<U>` | | G1 |
| `and_then<T, U>(r, f: (T) → Result<U>) → Result<U>` | | G1 |
| `map_error<T>(r, f: (Error) → Error) → Result<T>` | | G1 |

There is no accessor for the error alone: `match` reads it.

### 6.5 Small types

| Type | Definition | Available |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Unit` | A fieldless enum with the single variant `Value`. | Yes |
| `Cell<T>` | A class with one mutable field `value`, and the module function `of<T>(value)`. It exists so that closures, which capture by value, can share mutable state. | Yes |
| `IntRange` | An immutable class with the get-only fields `start` (inclusive), `end` (exclusive), and `step` (nonzero). Module functions `of(start, end)` and `stepped(start, end, step)`; a zero step traps. A negative step counts down while the value is greater than `end`. Members `size()`, `is_empty()`, `contains(value)`, `get(index)`, `to_list()`, and `iterator()`; it implements `Iterable<int>`, so `for (let i in range)` visits the values in order. `size` and iteration are computed in `int64` so that no intermediate overflows. | Yes |

`Pair`, `Entry`, and `Boxed` do not exist: a pair is the native tuple `[A, B]` (`partition` returns `[ArrayList<T>, ArrayList<T>]`, `divide_and_remainder` returns `[BigInteger, BigInteger]`, `enumerate` yields `[int, T]`, and `zip` yields `[T, U]`), and a map entry is the tuple `[K, V]`. No API on this page takes an `Object`.

Named types are kept where the name carries a contract a tuple cannot: `RegexMatch` (group lookup by name), `FileMetadata` (three fields of unrelated types that will grow), and the value classes of `Std.Time`.

### 9.7 `TreeMap<K, V>` and `TreeSet<T>`

Sorted collections ordered by a comparator given at construction. They need G1, because the comparator's type mentions `K`. A comparator is always required; for a built-in type pass its `compare` function. Two keys are the same key when the comparator returns `Equal`; `equals` is not consulted.

The balanced tree is an **AVL tree**. Lookups dominate, each comparison is a call through a function value, and an AVL tree is at most about 1.44 log2 of the size tall against about 2 log2 for a red-black tree.

Nodes are separately allocated. Missing child and parent links use `nil`.

- **Layout.** An unexported class `Node<K, V>` has `key`, `value`, `left`, `right`, `parent`, and `height` (`int`). Every node has a key and value. The tree stores a nullable `root`, `count`, its comparator, and the modification count. The root's parent is nil. A height helper returns 0 for nil without dereferencing it; a leaf has height 1.
- **Lookup** descends from the root calling the comparator with the probe key first: `Less` goes left, `Greater` goes right, `Equal` stops, and reaching `nil` means absent.
- **Insertion** descends the same way. On `Equal` it overwrites the value (not structural). Otherwise it attaches a new node, then walks up through `parent`: recompute each ancestor's height; if its children's heights differ by 2, rebalance with a single rotation when the taller child leans the same way and a double rotation when it leans the other way; stop when an ancestor's height is unchanged.
- **Removal.** A node with two children takes the key and value of its in-order successor, and the successor is unlinked instead. A node with at most one child is replaced by that child. Then walk up, recomputing heights and rebalancing, until a height is unchanged. The unlinked node becomes unreachable and is reclaimed; there is no free list and no slot to clear.
- **Rotations** update the child links and the parent link of each moved non-nil node. If the rotated subtree had no parent, update `root`. Never read or write a field on nil.
- **Iteration** is ascending: start at the leftmost node and step to the in-order successor through `right` and `parent`, with no stack.
- `TreeSet<T>` is a class holding a `TreeMap<T, Unit>`. A separate node class without a value would save one cell per element and duplicate the balancing code.

Lookup, insertion, and removal take logarithmic time.

### 11.1 `Std.Io`

**`Console`** is the module that replaces `SysIo.println`. It needs P2.

| Member | Behavior | Also needs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `print_line(s: string)` | Writes the text and one LF through `neura.console.write_line`. A failed write traps with `console write failed`. | F1 for the message |
| `try_print_line(s: string) → Result<Unit>` | The same write, returning the failure. | |
| `write(s)`, `error_line(s)`, and their `try_` forms | Write raw text through `neura.console.write`, to output or to the error stream. | T1 (text to bytes) |
| `format(pattern, args...)`, `vformat(pattern, args)`, and their `try_` forms | Render a [format string](StandardLibrary#console-formatting) to UTF-8 without calling a host service. | |
| `print`, `println`, `eprint`, `eprintln`, and their `try_` forms | Format first and then write to output or to the error stream. The newline forms append one LF. | T1, P2 |
| `read_line() → Result<Optional<string>>` | A line without its terminator; `None` at the end of input. | T1 |
| `output() → ByteSink`, `error() → ByteSink`, `input() → ByteSource` | The console as streams. | |

Console output is unbuffered in the library. Each completed format is sent in program order through the existing raw write paths. The byte paths repeat partial writes until they finish or return an error.

**Streams are function values.** A reader or writer is one operation with a concrete signature, which is what a native function value is, and a bound method supplies one from any object. The library declares no `ByteReader`, `ByteWriter`, `TextReader`, or `TextWriter` interface.

| Shape | Type | Contract |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ByteSource` | `(int) → Result<uint8[list]>` | Called with a maximum count of at least 1. Returns a new list of 1 through that many bytes, or an empty list at the end of the stream. |
| `ByteSink` | `(uint8[list]) → Result<Unit>` | Writes every byte, repeating partial host writes. Does not keep the list. |
| `TextSink` | `(string) → Result<Unit>` | Writes the string. |

The three names are this page's shorthand. A type overlay cannot name a function type, so library source spells each type out. Reading the method `read` of a `File` as a value binds the file and gives a `ByteSource`; a closure over anything else gives one too. Closing is not part of a stream: the code that opened a resource closes it.

| Class | Behavior | Needs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ByteBuffer` | An in-memory accumulator over a built-in `uint8` list. `write` (a `ByteSink` when bound), `to_list()`, the read-only field `size`, `clear()`, and `reader()`, a `ByteSource` over a copy. Equality, hashing, and text use the current ordered bytes. A reader's position is independent of its buffer, and mutating a buffer used as a hash key invalidates that key's stored hash. | None |
| `BufferedReader` | Built from a `ByteSource`. Holds up to 8,192 bytes (configurable, at least 16). `read` is a `ByteSource`; `read_exact(count) → Result<uint8[list]>` fails with kind `UnexpectedEnd`; `read_all()`. | None |
| `BufferedWriter` | Built from a `ByteSink`. Collects up to 8,192 bytes and passes them on when full and on `flush() → Result<Unit>`; the read-only field `buffered` is the number of bytes waiting. It does not close anything. | None |
| `Utf8Reader` | Built from a `ByteSource`. `read_scalar() → Result<Optional<uint32>>`, `read_line() → Result<Optional<string>>`, `read_to_end() → Result<string>`. Invalid UTF-8 fails with kind `InvalidData`. | T1 |
| `Utf8Writer` | Built from a `ByteSink`. `write` is a `TextSink`; `write_line(s)` adds one LF. | T1 |

`read_line` ends a line at LF and removes it, along with a CR immediately before it. A final line without an LF is returned; after that the result is `None`.

### 11.2 `Std.Fs`

Needs P2 for every host operation and T1 for `Path`.

**`Path`** is an immutable class holding normalized text.

- The separator is `/` on every host. The host service translates.
- **Normalization at construction:** repeated separators collapse; `.` components are removed; a trailing separator is removed except for the root; an empty result is `.`. `..` components are kept, because removing them is not correct in the presence of links.
- The read-only field `is_absolute` is true exactly when the text starts with `/`. Platform prefixes such as drive letters are passed to the host unchanged and are not interpreted.
- Module function `of(text)`. Members include `join(other: string) → Path`, `parent() → Path`, `file_name()`, `stem()`, `extension()`, `components()`, `resolve_lexically() → Path`, `starts_with(other: Path) → bool`, and `relative_to(base: Path) → Path`. An absolute argument to `join` replaces the path. `parent` returns `nil` when the path has no parent. `relative_to` returns `nil` when it cannot express the path relative to the base. `file_name`, `stem`, and `extension` return `Optional<string>`. The extension is the text after the last `.` of the file name when that dot is not the first character. `components` returns a built-in list of strings. Equality, hash, ordering, and text use the normalized path.

**`File`** is a class wrapping a host file ID. The module functions `open(path, mode: OpenMode) → Result<File>` and `with_open<T>(path, mode, body)`, the scoped helper of [section 5.5](Stdlib-Design#55-resources). `OpenMode` is a fieldless enum: `Read` (must exist), `Write` (create or truncate), `Append`, `ReadWrite` (must exist), `CreateNew` (fails with `AlreadyExists`). Members: `read` (a `ByteSource` when bound), `write` (a `ByteSink` when bound), `seek(offset: int64, origin: SeekOrigin) → Result<int64>` (`SeekOrigin`: `Start`, `Current`, `End`), `size() → Result<int64>`, and `close() → Result<Unit>` ([section 5.5](Stdlib-Design#55-resources)). A `File` is unbuffered.

**`Fs`** module:

| Member | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `read_bytes(path) → Result<uint8[list]>`, `read_text(path) → Result<string>` | `read_text` fails with `InvalidData` for invalid UTF-8. Both close the file on every path, including a failed read. |
| `write_bytes(path, bytes)`, `write_text(path, text)`, `append_text(path, text)` `→ Result<Unit>` | Create the file if needed; the `write_` forms truncate. A failed write is reported after the file is closed. |
| `exists(path) → Result<bool>` | `Ok(false)` for `NotFound`; other failures are errors. |
| `metadata(path) → Result<FileMetadata>` | `FileMetadata` is a class with the read-only fields `kind` (`FileKind`: `File`, `Directory`, `Other`), `size: int64`, and `modified: Instant`. |
| `list(path)` | A `Result` of a built-in list of `Path`: the directory's entries joined to `path`, sorted by name bytes. |
| `create_directory(path)`, `create_directories(path)` | The second creates missing parents and succeeds when the directory exists. |
| `remove_file(path)`, `remove_directory(path)` | `remove_directory` requires an empty directory. |
| `remove_tree(path)` | Removes depth first, in sorted order, without descending into an entry of kind `Other`. Stops at the first error. |
| `rename(from, to)`, `copy_file(from, to)` | `copy_file` streams through a 65,536-byte buffer, replaces an existing target, and closes both files on every path. |

"On every path" is written out in each function as explicit `match` arms that close before returning the error. There is nothing to defer to.

### 12.1 `Std.Time`

The value types are immutable classes with `compare_to`, `equals`, `hash_code`, and `to_string`. Their arithmetic is checked integer arithmetic and their text is digits and punctuation joined by concatenation. Each `parse` needs T1.

**`Duration`** is a signed count of nanoseconds in one `int64` (about ±292 years).

- Module functions: `of_nanos`, `of_micros`, `of_millis`, `of_seconds`, `of_minutes`, `of_hours`, `of_days` (24 hours), each taking `int64`; the constant `Zero`; `parse(text) → Result<Duration>`. Overflow traps (reason 1), here and in every member below.
- Members: `plus`, `minus`, `multiplied_by(int64)`, `divided_by(int64)` (truncating), `negated`, `abs`, `is_zero`, `is_negative`, `to_nanos`, `to_micros`, `to_millis`, `to_seconds` (each truncating toward zero), and `to_seconds_float64`.
- `to_string` is ISO 8601: `PT`, then hours, minutes, and seconds with their unit letters, omitting zero units, with a fractional second trimmed of trailing zeros (`PT1H30M`, `PT0.5S`). Zero is `PT0S`. A negative duration is `-` followed by the text of its absolute value.

**`Instant`** is a point on the UTC time line: `int64` seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z and an `int` nanosecond adjustment from 0 through 999,999,999. Leap seconds are ignored, as in POSIX time.

- Module functions `of_epoch_seconds(seconds, nanos)`, `of_epoch_millis`, the constant `Epoch`, and `parse`. The read-only fields `epoch_seconds` and `nanos`, and the members `plus(Duration)`, `minus(Duration)`, `duration_since(other) → Duration`, `to_epoch_millis()`, `to_local(offset: ZoneOffset) → LocalDateTime`.
- `to_string` is `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS` with a fraction of 3, 6, or 9 digits when the nanoseconds are not zero (the shortest of those that is exact), then `Z`. `parse` accepts that form and a numeric offset in place of `Z`.

**`Clock`** is an interface with `now() → Result<Instant>`, `monotonic() → Result<Duration>` (elapsed time from an arbitrary fixed origin, never decreasing), and `sleep(duration) → Result<Unit>`.

- `SystemClock` uses the clock host services (P2) and fails with `CapabilityDenied` when they are not allowed.
- `FixedClock` holds an instant set at construction; `set(instant)` and `advance(duration)` change it; `sleep` advances it and returns at once; it never fails. Library code that needs time takes a `Clock`, so tests pass a `FixedClock`.
- `Stopwatch` takes a `Clock` and offers `start`, `stop`, `reset`, `elapsed() → Result<Duration>`, and the read-only field `is_running`.

**Calendar types** use the proleptic Gregorian calendar.

- `LocalDate` stores `year` (-999,999 through 999,999), `month` (1 through 12), and `day`, read-only fields. The module function `of(year, month, day)` traps for an invalid date. `try_of(year, month, day) → LocalDate` returns `nil` for invalid components. Conversion to and from a day count since 1970-01-01 (`to_epoch_day`, `of_epoch_day`) uses the 400-year cycle of 146,097 days. Shift the year so that it starts in March, split it into the cycle and the year within the cycle, and compute the day of the cycle using floor division so that negative years work. Members include `plus_days`, `plus_months`, `plus_years`, `days_until(other) → int64`, `day_of_week() → DayOfWeek`, `day_of_year()`, `is_leap_year()`, and `length_of_month()`. Month and year changes clamp the day to the end of the target month. `DayOfWeek` runs from `Monday` through `Sunday`, with epoch day 0 on Thursday. Text uses `YYYY-MM-DD`. Years outside 0000 through 9999 have a sign and at least four digits.
- `LocalTime`: `hour()`, `minute()`, `second()`, `nano()`, computed from the nanoseconds of the day that it stores (`to_nano_of_day()`). `plus(Duration)` wraps around midnight. Text form `HH:MM:SS` with the same fraction rule as `Instant`.
- `LocalDateTime`: a `LocalDate` and a `LocalTime`, the read-only fields `date` and `time`. `plus(Duration)` carries into the date. `at_offset(offset) → Instant`. Text form: the date, `T`, the time.
- `ZoneOffset`: total seconds from -64,800 through 64,800, the read-only field `total_seconds`. The constant `Utc`, `of_hours_minutes`, text form `Z` or `±HH:MM`.

A read-only field is an exported `last` field (an `is_running` with a get-only [accessor](Types#accessors)): code outside the class reads it as `date.year` and cannot assign it. The value classes are `#Final`, and `#NoDiscard`, so a call whose result is dropped, such as `instant.plus(span);`, warns ([Tags](Tags)).

There is no time zone database, no named zones, and no daylight-saving rules. Conversions between instants and local times take an explicit `ZoneOffset`. The ISO forms above are the only text forms.

### 18.5 Time, randomness, and logging

- **Duration text.** `parse` accepts an optional sign, `P`, an optional day count, and `T` with hours, minutes, and seconds (seconds with up to nine fraction digits); days are read but never written.
- **Instant** normalizes the nanoseconds of `of_epoch_seconds` by floor division and writes every `int64` second count; `parse` accepts years -999,999 through 999,999.
- **ZoneOffset** holds whole minutes; hours and minutes share a sign, and `compare_to` orders by total seconds.
- **Clocks.** `Clock.sleep` returns at once for a zero or negative duration. `FixedClock.of(instant)` makes a fixed clock whose monotonic reading is the total of its advances and sleeps; `advance` traps for a negative duration. `Stopwatch.create(clock)`; `start` and `stop` return `Result<Unit>` and trap when repeated.
- **Calendar arithmetic** splits off 400-year cycles with one 64-bit division and works within a cycle in 32-bit arithmetic, which keeps images that format dates several megabytes smaller.
- **Random.** `seeded` and `from_entropy` are the only constructors; `from_entropy` fails with `InvalidData` when the host returns other than 8 bytes. **Uuid** stores two big-endian `uint64` halves and has `to_bytes`.
- **Trap details.** `invalid date`, `date out of range`, `invalid time`, `invalid zone offset`, `day of week`, `negative duration`, `bound must be positive`, `low must be below high`, and `negative count` after `invalid argument: `; `stopwatch is running` and `stopwatch is stopped` after `invalid state: `.
- **Logger.** `is_enabled(Off)` is false.
