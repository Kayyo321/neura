## Detailed contracts

The following sections are taken from the [standard library specification](Stdlib-Design) and the module's source comments. The source and the [language status](Status) identify shipped behavior.

### 5.7 Conformance summary

These are the intended source-module contracts. Compiler support for the operations does not imply that a collection module or adapter is already packaged.

| Type | Equality and hash | Natural order | Iterable | Interfaces (G4) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Integers, floats, `bool`, fieldless enums, `string`, tuples | Built in (G3a) | Companion `compare` functions | No (`Strings.scalars` gives a list) | |
| Array, list | Built in, structural (G3a) | No | Built-in for-each | |
| `Optional<T>`, `Result<T>`, `Error`, `JsonValue` | Module functions; payload enums have no built-in equality | No | No | |
| `ArrayList`, `LinkedList` | As lists | No | Yes | `MutableList`; `LinkedList` also `Deque` |
| `ArrayDeque`, `PriorityQueue` | Identity | No | Yes | `Deque` or `Queue` |
| `HashSet`, `TreeSet`, `BitSet` | As sets | No | Yes | `MutableSet`; `TreeSet` also `SortedSet` |
| `HashMap`, `TreeMap`, `OrdinalMap` | As maps | No | Yes, of `[K, V]` | `MutableMap`; `TreeMap` also `SortedMap` |
| `BigInteger`, `BigDecimal`, `Duration`, `Instant`, the calendar types, `Path`, `Uuid` | Yes, by value | `compare_to` member | No | `Comparable` |
| `RegexFlags`, `RegexMatch`, `Regex` | By value | No | No | |
| `StringBuilder`, `ByteBuffer` | Current byte sequence | No | No | |
| `Sequence`, `Random`, `Logger`, stream adapters, files, sockets | Identity | No | `Sequence` once | Streams: [section 11.1](Stdlib-Design#111-stdio) |

### 7.2 Arithmetic without wrapping intrinsics

The language has no wrapping arithmetic or sign reinterpretation. The checked operators, shifts that discard high bits, and masks are enough. Each recipe below says why no intermediate value leaves its type. The `uint32` and `uint64` multiplication recipes are tested in both build modes.

| Operation | Recipe | Why it fits |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Wrapping add or subtract, widths up to 32 | Convert both operands to the 64-bit type of the same signedness, operate, mask to the width, convert back. For signed types go through the unsigned pattern first. | The sum of two values below 2^32 is below 2^33. |
| Wrapping multiply, widths up to 32 | Convert to `uint64`, multiply, mask, convert back. | The product of two values below 2^32 is below 2^64. |
| Wrapping add, `uint64` | Let `room` be `Max - a`. If `b` exceeds `room`, the result is `b - room - 1`; otherwise `a + b`. | `Max - a` cannot underflow; `b - room - 1` is at least 0 because `b > room`; the other branch is at most `Max`. |
| Wrapping subtract, `uint64` | If `a` is at least `b`, `a - b`; otherwise `Max - (b - a) + 1`. | `b - a` is between 1 and `Max`, so `Max - (b - a)` is at most `Max - 1`. |
| Wrapping multiply, `uint64` | Split each operand into low and high 32-bit halves. The result is `low × low`, plus the low 32 bits of (`high_a × low_b` + `low_a × high_b`) shifted left by 32, with wrapping adds. | Each partial product has two factors below 2^32. The two cross products are each masked to 32 bits before they are added, so their sum is below 2^33. The shift discards the bits above 64 by definition. |
| Multiply by 5, 9, or 31 | A shift and a wrapping add or subtract. | Shifts discard high bits. |
| Signed to unsigned, same width up to 32 | A non-negative value converts directly. A negative value is converted to `int64`, 2^width is added, and the sum is converted. | A negative value is at least -2^(width-1), so the sum is between 2^(width-1) and 2^width - 1. |
| Unsigned to signed, same width up to 32 | A value below 2^(width-1) converts directly. Otherwise convert to `int64`, subtract 2^width, convert. | The difference is between -2^(width-1) and -1. |
| `int64` to `uint64` | A non-negative value converts directly. For a negative value, add `Int64.Max`, add 1, convert, and add 2^63. | Adding `Max` to a negative value gives at least -1; adding 1 gives a value from 0 through 2^63 - 1; adding 2^63 as `uint64` stays below 2^64. |
| `uint64` to `int64` | A value below 2^63 converts directly. Otherwise subtract 2^63, convert, add `Int64.Min`. | The difference is below 2^63, and adding `Min` to it gives a value from `Min` through -1. |
| Limb arithmetic for big numbers | Limbs are `uint32`; every intermediate is `uint64`. | A limb product plus an incoming carry plus an existing limb is at most (2^32 - 1)^2 + 2(2^32 - 1), which is 2^64 - 1. |

Signed wrapping operations convert to the unsigned pattern, operate, and convert back.

**What the recipes do not cover.** A float's bit pattern (N1). Everything else is on this table: hashing uses the 32-bit rows, `Random` and `Sha256` use the `uint64` and `uint32` rows, `BitSet` uses plain masks and shifts on `uint32`, and `BigInteger` uses the limb row.

### 12.2 `Std.Random`

**`Random`** implements the xoshiro256** generator using shifts, rotations, exclusive ors, and multiplication by 5 and 9. Use the `uint64` recipes in [section 7.2](Stdlib-Design#72-arithmetic-without-wrapping-intrinsics). `next_gaussian` depends on the library's `Math` module, and `from_entropy` requires a registered entropy provider.

- **State.** Four `uint64` words `s0` through `s3`.
- **Step.** The output is `rotate_left(s1 × 5, 7) × 9`, wrapping. Then, with `t` = `s1` shifted left by 17: `s2 ^= s0`; `s3 ^= s1`; `s1 ^= s2`; `s0 ^= s3`; `s2 ^= t`; `s3 = rotate_left(s3, 45)`.
- **Seeding.** The module function `seeded(seed: uint64)` fills the four words with successive outputs of SplitMix64 started at the seed: add 0x9E3779B97F4A7C15 to the state; take `z` as the new state; `z = (z ^ (z >> 30)) × 0xBF58476D1CE4E5B9`; `z = (z ^ (z >> 27)) × 0x94D049BB133111EB`; output `z ^ (z >> 31)`; all wrapping. The source writes these constants in decimal (A5). `from_entropy() → Result<Random>` requests 8 bytes from `neura.entropy.fill`, reads them as a little-endian `uint64`, and seeds with that.

| Member | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `next_uint64() → uint64` | One step. |
| `next_uint32() → uint32` | The high 32 bits of one step. |
| `next_bool() → bool` | The top bit of one step. |
| `next_int_below(bound: int) → int` | Uniform in 0 up to but excluding `bound`. Take the smallest all-ones mask covering `bound - 1`; draw `next_uint32` masked until the result is below `bound`. A bound below 1 traps. |
| `next_int_between(low: int, high: int) → int` | Uniform from `low` up to but excluding `high`. The span is computed in `int64`, sampled with the same mask-and-reject loop on `uint32`, and added to `low` in `int64`. `low` not below `high` traps. |
| `next_float64() → float64` | The top 53 bits of one step, converted to `float64` (exact) and multiplied by 2^-53: uniform in 0 up to but excluding 1. |
| `next_gaussian() → float64` | Marsaglia's polar method. Each accepted pair yields two values; the second is kept in the generator and returned by the next call. |
| `fill_bytes(count: int)` | A new built-in `uint8` list. Each step supplies 8 bytes, least significant first; a final partial group uses the low bytes. |
| `shuffle<T>(items: T[list])` | Fisher–Yates: for `i` from the last index down to 1, swap `i` with `next_int_below(i + 1)`. Generic, with no callback. |
| `choose<T>(items: T[list]) → T` | Traps with `no such element` for an empty list. |

The same seed gives the same sequence of results from every member, on every runtime, in every library version with the same major number. `Random` is not suitable for secrets, and the library offers no cryptographic generator.

**`Uuid`** is an immutable value of 16 bytes. The module function `random(random: Random)` makes a version 4 identifier from `fill_bytes`, then sets the version and variant bits. `to_string` writes the 36-character hyphenated form in lowercase. `parse(text) → Result<Uuid>` accepts either case and needs T1. It has `compare_to`, `equals`, and `hash_code` over its bytes.

### 18.1 Language and layout

- **Receivers.** A method cannot name its own receiver, so a member that returns "the same object" needs a stored self reference. `StringBuilder` keeps one, set by its factory `create()`. Classes whose invariants need a factory (`StringBuilder`, `Random`, `File`, `TcpStream`, `TcpListener`) take a module-private token or an internal handle in their constructors.
- **Constructor visibility.** An unexported `init` is private to its class, not to its module, so a module function cannot call it. `Regex` exports its constructor for that reason; an object built directly with it traps on use.
- **Module file names.** `Std.Core.UInt8` and `Std.Core.BFloat16` live in `u-int8.nra` and `b-float16.nra`, following the PascalCase to kebab-case mapping of [Project structure](https://github.com/Kayyo321/neura/wiki/ProjectStructure).
- **Optional and Result** import each other (`to_result` and `to_optional`); both contain only declarations. Files that import each other initialize as one cycle after the files the cycle imports ([Modules](https://github.com/Kayyo321/neura/wiki/Modules#initialization)).
- **Extra members.** `Error` and `Result` have `equals`, `hash`, and `to_string`, and `SimpleDetail` compares its code and message, so errors compare structurally. `Comparable<T>` is `Std.Core.Comparable`. The collection interfaces declare `add(T) → bool` for every mutable collection (lists return true), and a sorted map's `first`, `last`, `range`, and `descending` give entries while `floor`, `ceiling`, `lower`, and `higher` give keys, with `_entry` forms for entries.

### 18.5 Time, randomness, and logging

- **Duration text.** `parse` accepts an optional sign, `P`, an optional day count, and `T` with hours, minutes, and seconds (seconds with up to nine fraction digits); days are read but never written.
- **Instant** normalizes the nanoseconds of `of_epoch_seconds` by floor division and writes every `int64` second count; `parse` accepts years -999,999 through 999,999.
- **ZoneOffset** holds whole minutes; hours and minutes share a sign, and `compare_to` orders by total seconds.
- **Clocks.** `Clock.sleep` returns at once for a zero or negative duration. `FixedClock.of(instant)` makes a fixed clock whose monotonic reading is the total of its advances and sleeps; `advance` traps for a negative duration. `Stopwatch.create(clock)`; `start` and `stop` return `Result<Unit>` and trap when repeated.
- **Calendar arithmetic** splits off 400-year cycles with one 64-bit division and works within a cycle in 32-bit arithmetic, which keeps images that format dates several megabytes smaller.
- **Random.** `seeded` and `from_entropy` are the only constructors; `from_entropy` fails with `InvalidData` when the host returns other than 8 bytes. **Uuid** stores two big-endian `uint64` halves and has `to_bytes`.
- **Trap details.** `invalid date`, `date out of range`, `invalid time`, `invalid zone offset`, `day of week`, `negative duration`, `bound must be positive`, `low must be below high`, and `negative count` after `invalid argument: `; `stopwatch is running` and `stopwatch is stopped` after `invalid state: `.
- **Logger.** `is_enabled(Off)` is false.
